# Poki

Poki is a gRPC and protobuf based database inspired by CouchDB.

## Features

NONE!

## Roadmap

- Store protobuf messages via BoltDB.
- Implement all CouchApp functions (validator, updater, map, reduce, rereduce, transform).

### FAQ

- Why?
  - JSON has some issues with databases. Protobuf makes document storage stricter and easier to manage at the same time.
